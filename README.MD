# {^u^} Exercism Repository

This repository is dedicated to sharpening my Ruby programming skills and solving coding challenges from **Exercism.org**. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Ruby or an experienced programmer wanting to master this dynamic language, you'll find a variety of exercises here to practice and improve your Ruby skills.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for honing your Ruby programming skills through hands-on coding exercises. By working through these exercises, you'll not only gain a deeper understanding of Ruby but also become a more proficient programmer in general. The exercises cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, allowing you to gradually build your expertise.

## Solving Exercises:

Inside each exercise directory, you'll find a README.md file with the problem statement and any specific instructions for that exercise.

## Comments and Explanations:

In addition to solving the exercises, you're encouraged to provide comments and explanations in my code. This will not only help you understand myn solutions better but also serve as a reference for others.

Contributing
If you have solved an exercise and want to share your solution or improvements, feel free to create a pull request. Contributions are welcome, and they can help others learn and grow as programmers.
